This directory contains following files and folders:
1. Subcodes
	a. map.py
	b. motion_model.py
	c. sensor_model.py
	d. resampling.py

2. particle_filter.py (main particle filter file)

To run the particle filter using the current data:
"python particle_filter.py" in the main directory. It will first display the beam range finder model probability curve (which will automatically get closed in 2 seconds) and then it will start the particle filter.
